My first blog post has to be special. I am profoundly attratced towards quotes,Hence I going to list down some of the most beautiful quotes/proverbs I have come across with reason. 

Some general Ones
======

> 'Anything given to anyone can be taken back except time'

This quote may sound harsh, but Time is undervalued these days. One who values time always succeeds in many ways. 

> 'You are product of your surrounding'

As human beings our surroundings is the only prior from which we can learn the upper and lower limits. Any thing may sound new to us only if we havent heard through our surroundings. Hence, Surround yourself with good people is what my mother always recites to me. 

> 'People betray but knowledge never betrays' 

Again one of the proverbs which my mom has instilled in me. It is such as good feeling to gain knolwdge of many things around us. I am not just referring to techincal/formal education here but also to diverse recreational activities such as playing flute (which I am trying to learn)

> 'One must try to learn as much as knowledge as he can during his enitre lifetime'

Quoted by mom again and attempted to instill it in me.
